# Transaction-Fraud-Detection
Transaction Fraud DetectionThis project demonstrates an unsupervised machine learning approach to detect potentially fraudulent transactions using clustering and anomaly detection techniques. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset to identify unusual transaction patterns without relying on pre-labeled fraud data. This approach is highly effective for discovering new, unseen types of fraudulent activity.üìã Table of ContentsProject OverviewProject StructureMethodologyKey FindingsRecommendationsInstallation and Usageüìù Project OverviewThe primary goal of this project is to identify suspicious financial transactions using an unsupervised learning model. Instead of predicting a specific "fraud" label, the model analyzes the transaction data to find natural groupings and flag transactions that deviate from the norm.Domain: Finance / E-commerceDataset: Synthetic Fraud Dataset (CSV)Core Subject: Unsupervised Machine Learning (Clustering)üìÅ Project StructureThe project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook that follows a clear, multi-phase methodology:Problem Understanding: Defines the project's goal and justifies the use of an unsupervised approach for fraud detection.Data Collection & Preparation: Loads and explores the dataset, checking for missing values and data types.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes the data to understand the distribution and correlations of key features.Feature Engineering & Preprocessing: Scales numerical features and handles categorical data to prepare the dataset for the model.Dimensionality Reduction: Reduces the number of features using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to make the data more manageable for clustering.Clustering & Anomaly Detection: Utilizes the K-Means algorithm to group transactions into clusters and then analyzes those clusters to identify the most likely "fraud-prone" group.Insights & Recommendations: Interprets the model's findings and provides actionable recommendations.Deployment: Demonstrates how to save and load the trained models and includes a Streamlit dashboard for real-time predictions on new data.üß† MethodologyThe core of the methodology is a robust clustering workflow designed for efficiency and accuracy:Elbow Method: The Elbow Method is used on the inertia values of the K-Means model to determine the optimal number of clusters (k).Silhouette Score Validation: A subset of the data is used to calculate the silhouette score for the best candidate values of k from the Elbow Method. This balances speed with the reliability of the score.Model Training: The final K-Means model is trained on the full, PCA-reduced dataset using the optimal value of k.Cluster Profiling: The average values of key features (e.g., Risk_Score, Transaction_Amount) are calculated for each cluster to understand its characteristics.Fraud Identification: A "High-Risk / Fraud-Prone" cluster is identified based on profiling, typically by looking for small, distinct clusters with a high average risk score.üí° Key FindingsThe dataset was clean, with no missing values, allowing for a straightforward preprocessing pipeline.PCA successfully reduced the dimensionality of the data, retaining a significant portion of the variance.K-Means clustering effectively segmented the transaction data into distinct groups.The profiling of these clusters revealed one as a clear outlier, characterized by a higher average Risk_Score and other fraud indicators. This cluster was labeled as "High-Risk".üöÄ RecommendationsPrioritize the high-risk cluster: Any new transaction falling into the "High-Risk / Fraud-Prone" cluster should be flagged for immediate review.Categorical Feature Analysis: Conduct further analysis of the categorical features (Transaction_Type, Merchant_Category, etc.) within the high-risk cluster to uncover specific fraud patterns.Model Enhancements: Explore other anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor) to complement this clustering approach and potentially improve detection accuracy.‚öôÔ∏è Installation and UsageClone this repository:git clone [repository_url]
